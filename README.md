ScoreBook is a simple mobile application for keeping track of scores in e.g. card games, darts, uno, etc. You can find the published version in [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.qtproject.example.ScoreBook).

This application uses the [Qt application framework](http://www.qt.io/), and is thus easily extensible to all the Qt supported platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, OS X, WinRT, etc.)

This application uses my app-library for managing game contents and windowing.
